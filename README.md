# BCSL
Basic CSharp Library is a simple, yet powerfull 2D game engine. 
it uses monogame to power the backend of the project and using https://github.com/NightfoxGames/BCSPhysics (My Physics Library) makes it extra powerfull.

# WARNING
My library uses MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task version 3.8.1.303 and MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX version 3.8.1.303, you can download those in NuGet in VS
