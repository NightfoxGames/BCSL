# BCSLibrary
Basic CSharp Library is a simple, yet powerfull 2D game engine. 
it uses monogame to power the backend of the project and by using [My Physics Engine](https://github.com/NightfoxGames/BCSPhysics) makes it extra powerfull.

## WARNING
My library uses 
1. **MonoGame.Content.Builder.Task** version **3.8.1.303**
2. **MonoGame.Framework.WindowsDX** version **3.8.1.303**

you can download those in _NuGet_ in Visual Studio
